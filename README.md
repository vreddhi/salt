# AWS Infrastructure to setup Traffic Mirroring

Traffic mirroring is a way to mirror/capture traffic of interest on a server.

The traffic mirror targets are the destinations for mirrored traffic. An Elastic Network Interface or Network Load Balancer can serve as mirror targets. A mirror target can reside in the same AWS account or routed to another AWS account. 

The traffic is forwarded to UDP port 4789 on the target.  The inbound traffic must be allowed in the targetâ€™s Security Group.

VXLAN traffic is essentially just a UDP packet with encapsulated data. Any normal network capture tool, such as tcpdump, can capture and view the data.


This repository contains terraform code to provison AWS resources to serve the above purpose.
Following are the details of individual files.

1. vpc.tf : Provisions VPC, subnets, routetable(s) needed
2. security_group.tf : Provisons the necessary ingress and egress rules for resources to communicate
3. instance.tf : Provisons 2 EC2 servers, in appropriate VPC and subnets 
4. eip.tf : Reads the elastic IP variable and associates it to two EC2 machines
5. traffic_mirror.tf : Provisions the Traffic mirror filter, rule, target and the session.
6. variables.tf : hosts all the variables needed for this setup

7. backup_pcap.sh : A shell script which runs tcpdump indefinitely filtering traffic on port 4789
8. reverse_proxy.sh : A post bootup script, that installs docker and runs a reverse proxy nginx server

Further there is a simple docker file, which uses vanilla nginx and copies a custom configuration file to passthough all the requests, to ensure the reverse proxy is setup.
